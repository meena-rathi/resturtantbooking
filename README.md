## Introduction ##


## User Personas ##

A family wants to spent time together with delicious food.
A person wants to go with his firends for dinner or lunch. 

## User Stories ##
I have designed the user stories outlined in my GitHub project.
I followed the agile methodology to implement my project using GitHub Projects.
Each user story has its own acceptance criteria.

The user storys in my GitHub project are as follows:

..* As a site user, I can easily create an account to access the website.
..* As a site user, I can make a reservation for a table on the current date or future dates so that I have a reservation.
..* As a site user, I can see my reservation.
..* As a site user, I can edit or delete my reservation.
..* As a site admin, I can create, delete, and update reservations.
